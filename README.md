The histogram shows the distribution of the price change for petrol and diesel fuel types in the dataset. It visualizes how frequently the price change occurred for each fuel type.
The x-axis represents the price change, which is the difference between the selling price and the present price. The y-axis represents the frequency of each price change value.
From the histogram, we can see that the price changes for both petrol and diesel are mostly clustered around zero, indicating that the selling price is roughly equal to the present price. Additionally, the petrol fuel type has a higher frequency of negative price changes, while diesel has a higher frequency of positive price changes. This suggests that there may be differences in supply and demand between the two fuel types. Therefore on a buyers percpective the petrol fueltype cars have a lower price change which means the cars are offered at almost similar prices as the selling price maintaining the value of the car.
A higher price change means that disel cars depriciate rapidly as their value decreases rapidly, which could be a concern or the market is overpricing the initial prices of the diesel fuel type cars, there could be other reasons for the decline in present prices therefore its a concern to look out for.
Based on the analysis above buying a petrol fuel type car is better.
